# Career Compass App

A beautiful, thoughtful career planning application designed to help professionals define their North Star vision and create actionable career paths.

## 🧭 Overview

The Career Compass app guides users through a structured 4-step framework to move from long-term vision (5-10 years) to immediate action (0-90 days). Unlike rigid career planning tools, this compass-based approach adapts as your goals and circumstances evolve.
